The Compleat Strategyst
=======================

This project has implementations of the algorithms in the book
*The Compleat Strategyst* by J.D.Williams. The book is a primer,
devoted to motivating and explaining technique with less emphasis
on mathematical justification. It's also funny.

Games are abstracted to matrices with a notion of value. Solving
a game means finding the maximum value and the means of achieving it.
